# [The Biblical Flood That Will Drown California](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2020/08/california-flood-arkstorm-farmland-climate-change/)


### Source code:
- [HTML](post-body.html)
- [CSS](custom-css.css)

### Shortcodes used:
- `[slides]`
- `[slide]`
- `[two-up]`

### Shortcode reference:
- [Docs site](https://docs.motherjones.com/2019/06/27/shortcodes/)

### Notes:
- This one does some CSS trickery with its section breaks, using the scrolly `[slides]` shortcode to make it look like water is "flooding" over an image. The CSS hides everything inside a slide and then give the slide itself a background color.
