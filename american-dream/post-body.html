<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="section-lead">From the moment Donald Trump</span> descended the infamous escalator in 2015, he made clear his intention to terrorize immigrants. Four years later, the enduring images of his presidency were <a href="https://time.com/longform/texas-el-paso-bridge-migrants/">outdoor cages</a> packed with <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/07/border-holding-facilities-immigrants-photos-horrible-conditions/">migrant families</a> and kids being <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Immigrant-parents-struggle-to-find-separated-13040534.php">ripped</a> from their parents’ arms. Then came impeachment, and COVID, and an economic crash, and election season. Judging by cable news and front-page headlines, immigration had been largely forgotten.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But not by the Mauritanian electrician who was deported after 20 years in the United States to a country that still has slavery. Or the Indian coder</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">afraid to unpack the boxes in his New York apartment for fear that he could be forced out at any moment. Or the Iraqi woman who stopped getting food stamps for her baby in order to preserve her husband’s shot at a green card.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The immigration system, already flawed and arbitrary before Trump, has become something <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/immigration-donald-trump-stephen-miller-asylum-destroyed/">much crueler</a>, with repercussions far beyond the Mexican border.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress’ decades-long failure to pass immigration legislation has ceded virtually all decision-making to the president, and so immigrants find themselves at the mercy of whoever is in the White House. This administration has shown them none.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we share the stories—in their own words—of eight would-be Americans who ran into Trump’s crackdown on legal and unauthorized immigration. In some cases, their futures hinge on what happens next Tuesday. For others, the results of the election are moot. It’s already too late. </span>
