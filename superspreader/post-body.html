<span class="section-lead">On January 22, </span>two days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, President Donald Trump breezily declared, "We have it totally under control." Since then, we have witnessed the devastating consequences of his attempt to spin, bluster, and blame his way out of a national emergency that will go down as the greatest scandal of a scandal-plagued presidency. On the eve of the most important election of our lifetimes, more than 200,000 Americans have died, more than 7 million have been infected, and the numbers in many states are still getting worse. And now, an outbreak centered around Trump and his White House has further exposed just how careless and callous his response to the virus has been. This timeline details how we got here. <em>Check back for regular updates.</em>
