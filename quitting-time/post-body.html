<span class="section-lead">Quitting stories are work stories,</span> and work stories are, as Studs Terkel wrote, “about violence—to the spirit as well as to the body.” Below are accounts from people who recently quit their jobs in protest, in the midst of a pandemic and an economic cataclysm, because they got fed up with the forms of violence, whether bodily or spiritual, that they’d been told to accept.

They quit because they didn’t want to die for their paychecks. They quit because they could no longer bear being a part of a racist, exploitative system. They quit on the spot. They quit after a great deal of consideration. A teacher quit after her father died cleaning schools. A cop quit because he didn't want to help gentrify a neighborhood. A Bojangles drive-thru worker quit because her boss served free food to the racists who'd harassed her.&nbsp;

Some of their stories convey the seditious thrill of finally saying no to bosses who expect yes. Many are full of uncertainty. “It’s sort of an identity crisis," said an occupational therapist who quit over a lack of safety precautions at work. "Who am I now?” Most were quick to point out that they quit because they had the privilege to do so—acts of conscience being too great a luxury for people who can’t afford to miss a check.

Since January 2020, more than <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=yd2f">25&nbsp;million people</a> have voluntarily left their jobs. These are the quitting stories of a few of the them, told in their own words. They are also, in a way, the stories of the people who don't have the luxury of quitting—of the daily humiliations they endure and the noes they never get to say.&nbsp;

Bojangles is a Southern fast-food chain that specializes in fried chicken and biscuits. Tibbs worked at a location in Greensboro, North Carolina.
"Unit director" is Bojangles' workspeak for a general manager at the chain.
Tibbs was harassed two weeks after the death of George Floyd.
With the support of family, friends, and local Greensboro activitists, Tibbs has filed complaints about the incident with Bojangles' corporate office and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she said.
A recording of the meeting, reviewed by _Mother Jones_, confirms this exchange.
You can see Thompson's work [here](https://shorturl.at/eAKY0).
United Communications Corporation, the _Kenosha News_' family-owned publisher since 1961, [sold the paper](https://shorturl.at/ehRY8) in February 2019 to media conglomerate Lee Enterprises. Lee, which owns more than 400 outlets nationwide, beat last quarter's earnings expectations by almost $3 million.
Thompson's GoFundMe (which I gave to before I was assigned this interview) launched after discovering a fake one set up in his name had raised almost $45,000. He plans to donate half to organizations in Kenosha's Uptown neighborhood and use the other half to set up a new outlet for Kenosha-area news.
Krishna left the _Bon Appétit_ Test Kitchen in August, but she is still a regular contributor to _Bon Appétit_ magazine. The two entities are managed by separate divisions of the Conde Nast company.
Krishna, already a popular food writer and cook for _Bon Appétit_ magazine and the _New York Times_, among others, first joined the Test Kitchen videos in 2018 as part of a team that quickly became a viral sensation online. Known for their creative yet approachable recipes and jovial banter, the Test Kitchen team was an instant online favorite.
Priya's book, [_Indian-ish_](https://www.priyakrishna.me/indianish), came out last year. It is an homage to her upbringing and especially her mother's recipes, inspired by her Indian heritage as well as her travels around the world.
After Priya and others at _Bon Appétit_ spoke up about tokenism in the Test Kitchen, it sparked a public uproar, with people making [compilation videos](https://shorturl.at/ipr34) of all the times staff of color were called on to make "ethnic" recipes and perform unpaid labor in the background
In June, Adam Rapoport steped down as editor-in-chief of _Bon Appétit_ after old pictures surfaced of him in brownface. It was the culmination of a scandal that began after several POC writers and producers made allegations of a culture of racism and exclusion that permeated _Bon Appétit_'s brand.
A representative from Condé Nast said that the company had made an effort to bring more transparency to its pay practices. It has also set a standard pay rate for all on-air talent.
Fellow Test Kitchen stars Sohla El-Waylly and Rick Martinez quit _Bon Appétit_'s video team at the same time as Priya, also citing racism and pay inequity as reasons for their departure.
When asked about this, Condé Nast responded: "We worked very hard to try to retain everyone in the test kitchen. We made a good faith effort [during negotiations], but we weren't able to get there with everyone. But we had to stay true to our principles of consistency."
Yes, this is my mother.
The library shut down on March 16, five days before New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo [ordered](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-guidance-essential-services-under-new-york-state-pause-executive-order) all non-essential businesses statewide to pause in-person operations.
The Bedford Pine Apartments is a 733-unit HUD-subsidized apartment complex in Atlanta's rapidly gentrifying Old Fourth Ward. It's the largest Section 8 housing complex in the Southeast.
Between 2013 and 2018, the average home price in Old Fourth Ward [jumped by more than 135 percent](https://shorturl.at/enzOX) between—the steepest increase of any Atlanta neighborhood.
Real estate investors are now [snapping up properties](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/20/business/economy/starter-homes-investors.html) in the historically Black neighborhood, best known as the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr.
Atlanta boasts a [unique history](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/23/nowhere-for-people-to-go-who-will-survive-the-gentrification-of-atlanta) when it comes to low-income housing: It was the first American city to build public housing projects, in 1936, as well as the first to tear them all down. Now all that remains is the Section 8 program, in which private landlords accept federally funded housing vouchers.
A company called Wingate owns and operates Bedford Pine Apartments, as well as properties in 16 other states across the country. A consultant for the company told _Mother Jones_ that it is committed to maintaining Section 8 and other affordable housing in Old Fourth Ward, and pointed out that it hasn't issued a single eviction during the coronavirus pandemic. (Atlanta had an [eviction moratorium](https://www.atlantaga.gov/Home/Components/News/News/13404/672) in place until August 31.)\n"In the course of its operations, Wingate has built an excellent and productive partnership with law enforcement in the neighborhoods surrounding its facilities in Atlanta, led by our private security firm," the company wrote in an emailed statement. "We regularly employ off-duty police officers for security. These officers are engaged to protect our facilities, residents and team members, and have been cooperative, responsive and helped to ensure the safety of our residents and team members. When crimes are being committed in or around our property, security does investigate swiftly and professionally for the safety of our residents and team members. We evict residents only for lease violations. The police have absolutely no role in eviction.\n"The introduction of market rate housing in the Bedford Pines area to date has nothing to do with Wingate. We have no management or investment interest in any of those developments. We are on a program of preservation housing, to much acclaim from the community and the police. This means taking residents out of old housing into new apartment homes with modern amenities. Every Section 8 unit will be replaced with a Section 8 unit."
The consultant added that there is no dedicated APD office on their property but concedes that the company has "explored this concept."
A representative for the Atlanta Police Department told _Mother Jones_ that the area near Bedford Pine Apartments is "well known for the sale of narcotics and other crime to include several shootings over the past year. Officers have been able to identify a lot of the vehicles parked in the roadway in front of the complex as a base of operation for the drug sales and other incidents. To combat this, APD in conjunction with the City of Atlanta designated the area a no parking zone. Multiple 'No Parking' signs were put into place well in advance of any enforcement, with the date and time the new rules went into effect on each sign. Only after this, were any parking tickets issued or any vehicles impounded. Additionally, we did partner with private security at the location to issue criminal trespass orders to non-residents that were suspected to be involved in the aforementioned crime. No orders to stop citizens and perform background checks for anyone standing on the sidewalks were given."
Multiple APD officers were [fired and charged with assault](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/atlanta-police-charged-protest/index.html) after dragging two students out of their car and tasing them while they tried to leave a protest in solidarity with George Floyd. Gissler says they were following direct orders from the top brass. APD told _Mother Jones_ that all protesters were allowed to leave, even after the city's curfew went into effect. Only those that refused to leave were arrested.
In an email, a school district representative said that if the district had not opened up Brick and Mortar, "the state would’ve modified our funding from the Florida Education Finance Program for a full-time student to a full-time virtual student, which is funded at about $2,000 less per student. At 44,000 students, that equates to about $88 million."
Cooper ran at Washington State University for two years. In 2019, he ran for the University of California, Berkeley, where he is now finishing his master's degree.
On August 2, the _Players' Tribune_ published [#WeAreUnited](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/pac-12-players-covid-19-statement-football-season), a list of demands from hundreds of Pac-12 athletes who'd been galvanized by the NCAA's handling of the coronavirus pandemic to more thoroughly oppose the ways in which "NCAA sports exploit college athletes physically, economically and academically, and also disproportionately harm Black college athletes." Athletes demanded to be paid, to form a union, and to end racial injustice, among other things. Cooper was a signee and involved in planning the letter.
For years, athletes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were steered by academic advisers to classes that required little work beyond the completion of a single paper at the end of the semester. In 2014, academic adviser Mary Willingham published research—which the university has disputed—saying that many athletes could not read or write beyond an eighth-grade level. Willingham resigned, sued the university for creating a hostile work environment, and settled for over $300,000. The NCAA did not punish UNC, saying that because the "paper classes" were open to all, and not just athletes, the scandal was an academic one over which the governing body did not have jurisdiction.
The NCAA has [Student-Athlete Advisory Committees](http://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/ncaa-student-athlete-advisory-committees-saacs) at multiple levels: campus, conference, and national. These allow for students to "have a voice" on rules and regulations. But they do not have authority on protocols for athletes.
In 2014, the Northwestern football team attempted to unionize. Led by starting quarterback and star Kain Colter and backed by the United Steelworkers, players signed union authorization cards. Ultimately, their bid to unionize was rejected by the National Labor Relations Board, which punted on the fundamental question of whether college athletes should be considered employee.
Fagan wrote the book _What Made Maddie Run_, which told the story of college runner [Madison Holleran](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12833146/instagram-account-university-pennsylvania-runner-showed-only-part-story). Holleran committed suicide at the age of 19.
In a statement, a University of California, Berkeley, spokesperson called this a "misunderstanding": "To the best of our knowledge, no offer to attend a Pac-12 SALT conference was rescinded to Andrew or any other student-athlete." Cooper disputes this. He told _Mother Jones_ he was disinvited in person. Afterward, when he asked for email confirmation, he was refused. Cooper also shared with _Mother Jones_ text messages showing administrators asking him to attend SALT before the invitation was rescinded.
Daltoso and Cuhran were leaders of the #WeAreUnited campaign and both football players for the University of California, Berkeley.
"University System of Georgia institutions, including the University of West Georgia, provided guidance to employees who care for or live with individuals at higher risk for severe illness with COVID-19," said University of West Georgia spokesperson Colton Campbell. "They should plan to return to campus as scheduled during the Return to Campus and work with their direct supervisor to ensure their work environment allows for social distancing and the ability to practice the behaviors known to reduce the spread of the COVID-19."
In addition, the university asked faculty to buy [reopening kits](https://shorturl.at/diCHQ) with items that cost hundreds of dollars.
“Like many other universities, [the University of West Georgia] has developed a dual-modality delivery structure for every face-to-face class on campus," a spokesperson said in a statement. "These changes allow students to have access to in-person teaching and mentoring from faculty in a physical classroom setting while maintaining social distancing guidelines. Students in courses are divided into groups and attend in-person classes on alternating days or weeks, depending on how often the course was originally scheduled to meet."
"On March 16, 2020, all University System of Georgia institutions, including UWG, moved to online instruction for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester and the entirety of the summer 2020 semester in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. UWG is not aware of recent institutional incentive programs for online instruction," a spokesperson said.
“That statement is not correct," a spokesperson said. "In developing our university plans in response to COVID-19, we have depended on the input of hundreds of faculty and staff members to research, develop, and implement our plans. Seven cross-divisional working groups—with representation of both faculty and staff—were charged with developing these plans for our Return to Campus. Shared governance will continue to play a major role going forward, as we chart the course for the university’s future.”
The chapter also sent along multiple documents showing faculty concerns, and ongoing discussions, about the lack of input and "shared governance" in COVID-19 response at the university.
Walker said negligence at the facility was not unprecedented. After a technician quit, she was asked to hand out pills to residents. “Without training, I got thrown into handing out pills illegally,” she explained. “The shift before would pull the pills and then I'd hand them out. My boss was telling me that I had to do it and I didn't know it was illegal until I found out recently. There were a lot of horror stories.”
In an [interview](https://www.wpxi.com/news/investigates/women-quit-jobs-adult-care-center-claiming-facility-mishandled-pandemic-response/Q3C5GKOPFNEOJGQFJDL6K35TD4/) with Channel 11, Walker said she was encouraged to go to work after testing positive. Three other employees who also reportedly quit their jobs at the facility in recent weeks said personal protective equipment wasn't provided. Co-owner Rob Short told Channel 11 that the facility had "the resources required by the CDC" and that TLC "does adhere to the universal mandate to test staff and residents for COVID-19."
Access to the internet has always been unequal in America, but the pandemic has thrown these digital disparities into sharp relief. Everything from school to work to doctor's visits to court appointments has moved online as people try to adhere to social distancing protocols. But according to data from a [recent survey](https://shorturl.at/htuT1), students who are on food stamps (about a fifth of the American population) are 16 percent less likely to have access to high-speed internet and 10 percent more likely not to have access to internet at all. At the same time, public internet access points like libraries and schools have been shut down for extended periods. Once a luxury, the internet is now more than a utility. It's a [lifeline](https://shorturl.at/fF258).
A Comcast/Xfinity spokesperson says that, according to [two studies](http://www.shorturl.at/uyzW0), the 25/3 mbps provided by the Internet Essentials plan is sufficient for supporting multiple concurrent people videoconferencing in the same household. One of the studies showed it can support at least five concurrent sessions. They also noted that they [increased the speed](http://www.shorturl.at/gowIY) of the Internet Essentials program at the beginning of the pandemic in mid-March and that while calls regarding the Internet Essentials program generally increased over the course of the pandemic, Internet Essentials customer care calls did not increase. “We are always evolving the service, and remain committed to do more to support digital equity and help families stay connected,” says the spokesperson.
The pandemic has disproportionately impacted working women, _the 19th_ [reported](https://19thnews.org/2020/08/americas-first-female-recession/), as they're the most likely to leave their job to take over child care responsibilities.
After she left, the city remained a hotspot: residents faced [curfews](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/24/el-paso-coronavirus-curfew/) and such rapid death that county detention [inmates assisted the morgue](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/15/coronavirus-texas-el-paso-inmates-morgue-deaths/) with bodies awaiting autopsy.
